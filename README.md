# flame-detection

<h1>-main.py</h1>
##Implementation In Python

Libraries such as GPIO or RPi.GPIO can be used to interface with the flame sensor, and use the smtplib library to send the email.

#-main.cpp
##Implementation In C++

This code uses the WiFi and WiFiClientSecure libraries to connect to a Wi-Fi network and the SmtpClient library to send an email. You would need to replace SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASSWORD, RECIPIENT_EMAIL, WIFI_SSID, and WIFI_PASSWORD with the appropriate values for your setup.

If the flame sensor detects a fire (flameSensorValue is greater than 800), the code uses the smtp.send() function to send an email with the subject "Fire detected!" and the message "There is a fire!" to the recipient email address. If the email is sent successfully, the code prints "Email sent successfully" to the serial monitor. If not, it prints "Email sending failed".

Note that the SmtpClient library requires that you have a secure connection to your email server (using SSL/TLS). This is why the WiFiClientSecure class is used instead of the regular WiFiClient class. If your email server does not support secure connections, you may need to use a different library or approach to send the emai
